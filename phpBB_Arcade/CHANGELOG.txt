	Until now, the "submit_post" basic function of  phpBB was used for announcements (Game, tournament, top 10 and game report),
	but from this release on, we start with no longer support it, as it does a lot of unnecessary database and PHP work,  that we do not need.
	In this way, we can save a lot of memory and queries, and of course the work time is significantly reduced.

	The following has been removed from the imported "submit_post" feature:
		1. Notification tasks and related events.
		2. Track tasks.
		3. Approval tasks.

	1. Game description.
	2. Game controller.
	3. Scoring type.
	4. Privacy Policy, link.

	Updates of inherited games are also updated the same way, just like updates of the same game descriptions, in order to stay below the server limits.
	We didn't put the two update processes under one update process because the descriptions of the inherited games may be different from each other.
	Identical controller update has been removed as it was included under inherited game data auto-update.

	When updating a game, the tasks are executed in the following order:
	1. Update an edited game.
	2. Update inherited games, if the edited game includes inherited games.
	3. Update of the same game descriptions, if it has been confirmed and there are still games waiting to be updated.

		   so all games that have a resize feature remain inactive, thus avoiding duplicate resizing runs and conflicts.
		 2. Eliminates any pixel slip problems.
		 3. If a game uses multiple canvases within a game, we avoid flickering when resizing different layers at different times.
		 4. Reduced memory usage on users devices.
		 5. No need to explore canvas and viewport anymore.

		13. Instant lightning-fast resizing.
		14. Framework analysis in less time.
		15. Faster game launch.
		16. Perfect display.
	Since there is no longer a game where resizing should be disabled, some variables that can be used during game adaptation have been deleted:
